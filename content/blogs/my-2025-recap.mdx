## Introduction
It's been a while since I wrote the latest article, because I'm quite busy with my current professional and personal life. However, I want to take a moment to reflect on my year 2025 and share some highlights and lessons learned.

As many of you know already, I worked from the office more often in my current workplace. The commute was tiring since I have to spare my time around 2-3 hours dialy just to go to and from the office at Jakarta (my home is at Bogor). Besides of that, I also have a duty as a seasonal lecturer at a university in Jakarta, which requires me to balance my time between work, teaching, and personal life.

This is it's quite challengeing, but I managed to find a rhythm that works for me. But, let me share some of the highlights of my year 2025 around my personal and professional growth. For the professional growth, I'll highlights some of what I've learned since I worked at an enterprise grade company.

## My Current Work-Life Balance
I found that so many people in my age have several jobs to sustain their life. Some of them work as a full-time employee, while also having a side hustle or freelance work. I personally think that having multiple sources of income is a good way to diversify your income and reduce financial risk.

But again, it also requires good time management and prioritization skills. When I deep dive into this topic, they can did that because majority of them are work from anywhere (remote) or have flexible working hours. This way, they can allocate their time more efficiently and avoid burnout. Back to my current situation, it's quite challenging since I work from the office and have fixed working hours. However, I try to make the most of my time by planning ahead and setting clear boundaries between work and personal life.

Luckily, since last year my lecturer which was my examiner and the head of Information System Program when I was a graduate student, invited me to be a seasonal lecturer at his university. So, I accepted the offer and started teaching in since October 2024. To be honest, teaching isn't a new thing for me since I have experience as a lab tutor when I was in college. However, teaching as a guest/seasonal lecturer at a university level is a different experience altogether. It requires me to prepare lesson plans, assignments, and assessments, as well as to engage with students and provide feedback.

I don't need to teach every week. I only have a mandatory to teach 2 live online classes per subject per semester, plus some offline classes when I have free time on weekends. This way, I can still focus on my main job while also pursuing my passion for teaching.

If you ask me what topics that I teach, I usually teach about corporate systems, information systems management, and digital transformation. These topics are relevant to my current job and also align with my expertise and interests.

Some of my colleagues asked me why I teach that subject since I'm a frontend developer during weekdays. My answer is simple: I also want to expand my knowledge and skills beyond frontend development. By teaching these topics, I can gain a deeper understanding of how information systems work in organizations and how they can be leveraged to drive business value. And currently if you noticed, AI covering so many technical things, including frontend development. So having a broader perspective on information systems can help me adapt to the changing landscape of technology and stay relevant in my field.

So yeah, here I am until now juggling between my full-time job and seasonal teaching gig. It's not easy, but I enjoy the challenge and the opportunity to learn and grow. I know it's not a fancy thing like my other friends who have side hustles in tech startups or creative industries, but for me, it's a meaningful way to contribute to society and make a difference in people's lives.

> In other words, my current state is back to the old days when I was a college student who also worked as a lab assistant tutor to support my living expenses. The only difference is that now I'm doing it on a larger scale and with more responsibilities.

## Professional Growth
Now I entered my first year working at an enterprise-grade company. So, during my 5 years career as a frontend developer, I worked in 3 different types of companies: a software house, an A series startup which actually I've shared this story before around 2022, a pre-seed startup, and now an enterprise-grade company. Each of these companies has its own unique culture, processes, and challenges. However, working at an enterprise-grade company has been a different experience altogether.

Yes, I still work as a frontend developer in a technology team, but the scale and complexity of the projects are much larger than what I've experienced before. In a year, I even have to switch my team twice due to internal reorganization. This means that I have to adapt to new team dynamics, workflows, and technologies.

At first, I think working at an enterprise-grade company would be boring and rigid, with lots of bureaucracy and red tape. However, I was pleasantly surprised to find that the company values innovation, collaboration, and continuous learning. There are many opportunities to learn new skills, attend training sessions, and participate in big conference and other events.

Here are some of the key lessons I've learned during my first year at an enterprise-grade company:

### Embrace The Longer Decision-Making Process
In an enterprise-grade company, decision-making processes can be longer and more complex than in smaller companies. This is because there are more stakeholders involved, and decisions need to be aligned with the company's overall. strategy and goals. I've learned to be patient and understand that sometimes, it takes time to get buy-in from all parties involved.

It's not because they want to slow things down, but rather because they want to ensure that decisions are well-informed and consider all perspectives since the enterprise-grade company has a lot of moving parts and interdependencies. So, I've learned to communicate effectively and provide clear rationale for my proposals to help expedite the decision-making process.

### ROI Talks Louder Than Technical Features
In an enterprise-grade company, business value and return on investment (ROI) are often prioritized over technical features. This means that when proposing new features or enhancements, it's important to demonstrate how they will contribute to the company's bottom line. I've learned to think beyond just the technical aspects of a feature and consider how it will impact the business.

Even if just need to change one line of code, if it can bring a significant business value, it will be prioritized over more complex features that may not have a clear ROI. For example, lately I only adjust some infrastructure code in my work repository to reduce the build time of our frontend application. It may seem like a small change, but it can have a big impact on the team's productivity and efficiency. The build and deploy time can be reduced around 60-70% from before, just by adding one line of code in the configuration file.

My tech lead even told me that this change is more valuable than adding a new feature that may not have a clear business impact. So, I've learned to focus on delivering value to the business and prioritize features based on their potential ROI.

For this matter, I think system thinking is very important to have, so we can understand how different parts of the organization and technology stack are interconnected and how changes in one area can impact others. Even I'm just a frontend developer currently, I have to understand how my work fits into the larger picture of the company's operations and goals.

### Relationships Matter
In an enterprise-grade company, building strong relationships with colleagues and stakeholders is crucial for success. I've learned that collaboration and teamwork are essential for delivering high-quality products and services. Building trust and rapport with colleagues can help facilitate communication and problem-solving.

There's a term in an enterprise-grade company called "business sponsor", which refers to a senior leader or executive who champions a project or initiative. Having a strong relationship with a business sponsor can help ensure that a project receives the necessary resources and support to succeed. So, I've learned to invest time and effort in building relationships with colleagues and stakeholders, as it can have a significant impact on my career growth and success.

Here's very reminding quote from my old friend who finally get his dream job after 5 years of "transit" from his first job until now:
> You have to win hearts in finance, ops, and IT all at once. Good relationships are your currency in an enterprise.

## Conclusion
Overall, my year 2025 has been a challenging yet rewarding experience. Balancing my full-time job and part-time (seasonal) teaching gig has taught me valuable lessons in time management and prioritization. Working at an enterprise-grade company has also provided me with opportunities for professional growth and development. I've learned to embrace the longer decision-making process, prioritize ROI over technical features, and build strong relationships with colleagues and stakeholders. As I look ahead to 2026, I'm excited to continue learning and growing both personally and professionally.

So for what's next for me in 2026? I think I'm no longer want to be a frontend developer only. I want to expand my skills and knowledge into other areas of technology, such as backend development, cloud computing, and data science, especially tech architect. Since AI can cover and speed up so many things in technical aspects, I want to be more versatile and adaptable to the changing landscape of technology.

Thank you for reading my recap, and I hope you found it insightful!
