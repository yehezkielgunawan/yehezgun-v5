# Introduction

> Have you ever felt exhausted, tired, or bored when following the frontend technology updates?

Don't worry, you're not alone. I also feel that when I was a beginner in frontend engineering. I feel enthusiasm when learning about front-end frameworks like Angular, Vue, and React (my current favorite framework). But it changes when the fire nation comes, LOL. You might be realized that recently the update of the frontend technologies is going faster and more massive than before.

Looking back over the years, I remember when I was learning Angular for the first time. Angular 6 is a shiny and powerful framework (for me) at that time. Then Vue and React come and change everything.

> Have you tried Vue? Hey, you should try React, it's fun and easy to learn. What? Do you still use Angular? Oh man, try this lib, blablablabla.

That makes me anxious actually. But I realized that I'm not alone. A lot of developers also face this issue. So, what's the sign of Frontend Fatigue? Tri Hargianto tells that you will feel these signs if you experience Frontend Fatigue.

## Feeling left behind and not relevant
I have felt this before. When I was working as a frontend engineer for the first time, I still use Ionic and Angular as my main framework. I sensed that I'm not relevant with my other friend who also works as a frontend engineer at the other company that uses React or Next.js.

The most uncomfortable moment is when I catch up or meet up with them both in person or online, their mindset about frontend development is highly advanced. I even have a friend who is very expert in React Development. He even understands how every React and Next.js features work. Yes, every single detail, including the updated one.

I feel more anxious when I saw a lot of job opportunities (as a Frontend Developer) requires skill that matches the updated framework or tools. For example, there's a job vacancy that mentions for the candidates must be skilled in React and Redux. As an Angular Developer before, I need to learn about that framework and library because I have never used it before for professional use.

## Worried that you cannot be an expert due to the fast-changing
Have you ever learned a programming language or framework for a while, then it releases a new update with the new features and syntax? It might make you mad because sometimes you need to re-learn it.

For example, when the class component in React is still famous among developers, all newbies out there learn to React through the class component. But it changes when the Hooks come, it enables developers to make the same effect (or logic) with just functional components. And of course, it causes many developers must re-learn React through Hooks and functional components.

Imagine this, this is an example of one framework. We cannot predict the future. Maybe one day there are some new frameworks with powerful features and then cause many companies to migrate from the old one to the new one.

## Exhausted because you have to understand too many things
Only learning the framework is not enough. You often need more resources or a third-party library to support your project using that framework.

When I first time learned React, I cannot learn only React itself. I have to learn the third-party libraries that can support my project like Redux, Chakra UI (UI Component) and React Router (React doesn't have a built-in router like Angular, so it needs the third party router). Sometimes, it makes me exhausted and almost burnout because I have to understand a lot of things.

## Troubled when choosing a library or tools
By reading the writing above, you will realize choosing a library or tools will be not easy as you think. And it's true. Too many options out there, and it makes the newbie developers confused about which one is suitable for their project. 

# How to Cope with It?
According to [Tri Hargianto](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6833370002012409856/), every framework or tool claimed that their solution is the best. But in reality, there's no "the best tool". __The important thing is the suitable solution for a problem.__

It's good to get updated, but don't let yourself be exhausted because of it. __Reading about the updates or the articles is enough.__ But if you want to use a library or framework for your projects, you can consider these things.

## What is the purpose of these tools?
Before you install it, make sure you know the purpose of why you want to use it. It is better to make the logic by yourself than installing an overpowered library that requires more resources _(depends on your project scope)_.

So depends on your project scope and requirements, consider that do you need the third-party library to support your project or you can make the logic by yourself?

Remember this, __every tool or third-party library requires more resources. Too much library installed in your project can affect the performance of your application.__

## Is It Solves The Problem?
Next, make sure the tool you use can solve the problem that you face. Back to basic, it depends on your project scope and requirement.

__If the library can boost your productivity, go ahead. But when it creates another new problem, think again.__

## Who Made This? Who Uses This?
By knowing the creator behind a framework or library, it can build trust from its users. You have to do some small research on the creator behind the tools that you use. Who is he/she? What's his/her background? Why did he/she make it?

Also, don't forget to find out the user segment of a framework or library. __By knowing the user segment, you can easily find a suitable community or forum when you do some troubleshooting.__

## Is It Popular? Is It Has Any Supportive Communities?
__The more users of a framework or library, the bigger communities that support it.__ 

For example, React. Why React is so popular nowadays? Because there's a lot of developers use React to develop their apps. When they face some issues or problems regarding React features, they discuss it at a forum like Stackoverflow. It will be easier when you do some troubleshooting because a lot of developers use it and share their problem-solving using React at the forum.

Most important thing is, __make sure the framework or library that you choose is stable for a long period of time.__ Don't let yourself wrongly choose a tool that is outdated or the newest tool but not stable _(still there're issues)_ yet.

Tri Hargianto concludes this:

> The wise way to overcome the Frontend Fatigue is to stop overthinking about all updates outside. Just learn what's make you curious and required in your current project.

The point is no matter how massive the frontend tech updates are, the most important thing is **back to basic, it depends on your needs.**

One more thing from me, **learn fundamentals first**. For example, when a person has solid CSS fundamental skills, he/she can easily understand when using *tools* like Bootstrap or Chakra UI.

On a different side, a person who straightly learns Boostrap and skips the CSS will be confused at the end when he/she has to make custom styling. He/she may be also exhausted when switching to another *tool* like Chakra UI because of its different syntax and concept.

> If you have a solid fundamental skill, it will *be* easier for you to switch to another *tool.*


And yeah, that's my experience with Frontend Fatigue. How about you? Let's discuss this here. Hope it inspires you even though I'm still an amateur, hahaha.
