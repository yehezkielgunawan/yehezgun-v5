## Introduction
Currently, I'm learning about React & Next.js. To understand how it works, I usually push myself to make some mini-projects using that framework. One thing I hate when I develop a project, it's about config.

It started when I knew a friend who made his starter template. I asked him, `Why do you make it?`. He answered, `Well I don't need to worry about the 'configuration' thing when I initiate a new project. So I can focus on the development process.`

I think it's a great idea. I also don't need to feel anxious about the configuration when I make a new project if I have my starter template.

Here's how I made my starter template using Next.js and Chakra UI.

## Project Initialization
This time, I used the example of the base starter template that Next.js provides.
```cli
npx create-next-app --example with-chakra-ui-typescript [YOUR_APP_NAME]
```
Next, I initiated the ESlint config so the code style can be consistent. I added `next-lint` at `package.json` and executed it. The details can be seen [here](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/eslint).
```json
"scripts": {
  "lint": "next lint"
}
```
After that, execute the command `yarn lint` or `npm run lint` to initiate `eslintrc.json`. I modified some things due to personal preferences. You also can adapt it to your preferences.
```js
{
  "env": {
    "node": true
  },
  "extends": [
    "next/core-web-vitals",
    "eslint:recommended",
    "plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended"
  ],
  "parser": "@typescript-eslint/parser",
  "plugins": ["@typescript-eslint", "import"],
  "settings": {
    "import/resolver": {
      "node": {
        "extensions": [".js", ".jsx", ".ts", ".tsx"],
        "moduleDirectory": ["node_modules", "src/"]
      }
    }
  },
  "rules": {
    "no-unused-vars": "off",
    "@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars": [
      "error",
      {
        "argsIgnorePattern": "^_"
      }
    ],
    "@typescript-eslint/explicit-module-boundary-types": "off",
    "@typescript-eslint/no-non-null-assertion": "off",
    "@typescript-eslint/no-inferrable-types": "off",
    "import/order": [
      "warn",
      {
        "groups": [
          ["builtin", "external"],
          "internal",
          "parent",
          ["sibling", "index"],
          "object"
        ],
        "newlines-between": "always",
        "alphabetize": {
          "order": "asc",
          "caseInsensitive": true
        }
      }
    ],
    "complexity": "warn",
    "no-console": ["error"]
  }
}
```
After finishing the ESlint config, I made a [Next SEO](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-seo) config. This library is used to modify the meta-tag which is usually used to optimize the SEO and make a preview for the web project.

First, install the Next SEO using `npm I next-seo`. Then, make `next-seo.config.js` at the root directory. This is my base configuration. You can accommodate with your preferences.
```js
/** @type {import('next-seo').DefaultSeoProps} */
const defaultSEOConfig = {
  title: "yehez-nextchakra-starter",
  titleTemplate: "%s | yehez-nextchakra-starter",
  defaultTitle: "yehez-nextchakra-starter",
  description:
    "Yehezkiel Gunawan's personalized Next.js + chakra-ui + TypeScript starter template",
  canonical: "https://yehez-nextchakra-starter.yehezgun.com",
  openGraph: {
    url: "https://yehez-nextchakra-starter.yehezgun.com",
    title: "yehez-nextchakra-starter",
    description: "Next.js + chakra-ui + TypeScript template",
    type: "website",
    images: [
      {

        alt: "yehez-nextchakra-starter.yehezgun.com og-image",
        width: 800,
        height: 600,
      },
    ],
    site_name: "yehez-nextchakra-starter",
  },
  twitter: {
    handle: "@handle",
    site: "@site",
    cardType: "summary_large_image",
  },
  additionalLinkTags: [
    {
      rel: "icon",
      href: "https://res.cloudinary.com/yehez/image/upload/v1630902976/Assassination_Classroom_-_Koro-sensei_smiling_head_fwpndi.svg",
    },
  ],
};

export default defaultSEOConfig;
```

## Folder Structure
The base config is done, now it's time to make the folder structure. The base folder structure from the example template is quite good, but I want some modification here. Here's mine.
```clean
/src
    /components
        /layout
        /motion
        /wrapper
    /functions
        /helper
    /pages
    /types
```

## Modify the Base UI
It's time to modify the UI and layout. Maybe I won't explain the whole process here. It will be too long to explain. You can modify the layout by your option.

Here's my result [https://github.com/yehezkielgunawan/yehez-nextchakra-starter](https://github.com/yehezkielgunawan/yehez-nextchakra-starter)rr.

## Deploy
Finally, the final step. Don't forget to push the project to your repo in Github or Gitlab. You can check [here](https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/faq/push-to-github/) for the details.

I used [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) as my hosting platform. It's easy to use, you can integrate your repository with Vercel, so every time you push an update, it also re-build the project. Read [here](https://egghead.io/lessons/next-js-deploy-a-project-on-vercel-formerly-zeit-from-a-github-repository) for the details.

After deployed, let's make the project a public template.
![Template Repo](https://diskusi-tech-production.s3.amazonaws.com/i/mzpxxxc6hdj4i6hd5un5.PNG)

Aaaanddd, that's it. You can use the template using this command
```bash
npx degit [REPOSITORY NAME] <APP NAME>
```
Example: 
```bash
npx degit yehezkielgunawan/yehez-nextchakra-starter test-template
```

For Next.js you can use the built-in command to initiate a project based on the example template.
```bash
npx create-next-app --example [Github Repository Link] <YOUR_APP_NAME>
```
Example : 
```bash
npx create-next-app --example https://github.com/yehezkielgunawan/yehez-nextchakra-starter test-template
```

Your life will be easier with this, so you can focus on the development process every time you initiate a new project, LOL. Congratulations!!!

Here's my starter template: [https://yehez-nextchakra-starter.yehezgun.com/](https://yehez-nextchakra-starter.yehezgun.com/)//. How about you? Not a perfect one, I know. But at least, it's very helpful for me.

Yeah, that's from me. I'm sorry if there're some typos or mistakes here. I'm still an amateur at making a tech article. Happy trying and you can give some feedback here if you want. Thank you.
