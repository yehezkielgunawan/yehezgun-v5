> This is actually my personal notes when I was migrating to Tailwind CSS v4 in my Next.js project. I thought it would be useful to share it with you too.

# Introduction

My current personal web is using daisyUI and Tailwind CSS as the main CSS utility tool and component library. I have been using Tailwind CSS for a while now, and I really like it. However, I have been using an older version of Tailwind CSS, and I decided to upgrade to the latest version, which is Tailwind CSS v4.

However, there's additional steps that you need to be aware of when migrating to Tailwind CSS v4. In this article, I will share my experience and the steps I took to migrate to Tailwind CSS v4 in my Next.js project along with daisyUI.

# Steps to Migrate
## Update Tailwind CSS

1. Before you going further, open your `tailwind.config.js` or `tailwind.config.ts` and remove the daisyUI plugin from the `plugins` array. This will enable Tailwind CSS upgrade tool can run safely.

```diff
module.exports = {
   content: ['./your-files/**/*.{html,js}'],
   // other stuff...
- daisyui: {
-   themes: ['light', 'dark', 'cupcake'],
- },
- plugins: [require("daisyui")],
}
```

2. Run the [official Tailwind CSS upgrade tool](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/upgrade-guide):

```bash
npx @tailwindcss/upgrade
```

## Update daisyUI version
1. Now you can install daisyUI 5 which is the newest version of daisyUI. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
npm install --save-dev daisyui@latest
```

2. Adjust and add daisy UI  in your global CSS file. In my case, I updated my `global.css` file to include daisyUI and additonal custom styles. And also take notes, you can add the `@plugin` directive to add daisyUI plugin in your `tailwind.config.js` file and some additional custom themes.

```css
@import "tailwindcss";
@plugin "@tailwindcss/typography";
@plugin "daisyui" {
	themes: nord --default, dim --prefersdark;
}

@custom-variant dark (&:is([data-theme="dim"] *));

@utility container {
	margin-inline: auto;
	padding-inline: 1rem;
	@media (width >= theme(--breakpoint-sm)) {
		padding-inline: 2rem;
	}
	@media (width >= theme(--breakpoint-lg)) {
		padding-inline: 4rem;
	}
	@media (width >= theme(--breakpoint-xl)) {
		padding-inline: 5rem;
	}
}

/*
  The default border color has changed to `currentColor` in Tailwind CSS v4,
  so we've added these compatibility styles to make sure everything still
  looks the same as it did with Tailwind CSS v3.

  If we ever want to remove these styles, we need to add an explicit border
  color utility to any element that depends on these defaults.
*/
@layer base {
	*,
	::after,
	::before,
	::backdrop,
	::file-selector-button {
		border-color: var(--color-gray-200, currentColor);
	}
}

@layer base {
	main {
		@apply container lg:max-w-5xl mx-auto mt-24;
	}
	article {
		@apply prose max-w-none dark:prose-invert;
	}
}

```

3. Now it's up to you to add the daisyUI themes that you want to use. You can do this by adding the `themes` property in your `tailwind.config.js` file. In my case, I added the `cupcake` and `dark` themes. Re-check your web styling in every changes you made. I can't guarantee that everything will work as expected, but at least you can see the changes and fix them one by one.

# Conclusion
That's it. Seems easy but it depends how complex your project is. Especially when you're using additional plugins or custom themes. There's a lot of major changes both in Tailwind 4 and daisyUI. You need to check it by your own one by one even you can just run the upgrade tool in one line terminal command. I hope this article helps you to migrate to Tailwind CSS v4 in your Next.js project along with daisyUI.
